1) How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you spot the bug?
- It was helpful because I don't have to spend hours trying to find a bug in a file that contains thousand lines of codes.
2) How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
- It takes less time to undo and redo things.
3) What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
- Pros: You can choose when to create a commit so that it doesn't get too big or too small.
-Cons: It can be forgotten and you have to know when is the right time to create a commit.
4) Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
- Because Git is specailized for coding & programming.
5) How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
- With commit IDs.
6) How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
- You can use commands to know where the bug happened and revert them back to the previous version.
7) Now that you have your workspace up, what do you want to try using Git for?
- Doing my assignments.
